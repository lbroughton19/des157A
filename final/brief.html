                    <p>I am choosing to do my final project on my Every Picture assignment. I previously made a game in which users look at a photo and guess the location. I received good feedback when I shared it with others, but there were comments about the difficulty and user experience. It was much too challenging for people without additional context. The map view itself was also overwhelming to those without a comfortable basis in geography.</p>
                    
                    <p>In order to alleviate this, I added logic to give users feedback when they guess. It now prompts the user on whether they should look more north, south, east, or west. I also changed the look and feel of the map so that it is more visually appealing and has better labeling from a long distance.</p>
