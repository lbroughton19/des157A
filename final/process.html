                    <p>For my design comp, I wanted to improve user experience by listening he difficulty and making it easier for players tog et points. The first thing I did was find a better map tile for the leaflet plug in, one that is more visually appealing and allows for user to see the labels of the continents when zoomed out by default. I then added some additional logic for letting the user know whether they should adjust their guess North, South, East or West. I noticed that users may not know which general direction NSEW correspond to, so I also added arrows using ASCII to give them even more context.</p>
